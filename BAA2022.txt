   OVERVIEW OF THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY
The purpose of this combined Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under Federal Acquisition 
Regulation (FAR) Part 35 and Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) under 2 Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR) 200.204 (henceforth referred to as “BAA”) is to solicit research 
proposals for submission to the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command 
(DEVCOM) Army Research Laboratory (ARL) for funding consideration.
Prior to this announcement, ARL announced two separate BAAs to support the mission: 1) 
W911NF-17-S-0002 titled “Army Research Laboratory Army Research Office Broad Agency 
Announcement for Fundamental Research”; and 2) W911NF-17-S-0003 titled “Army Research 
Laboratory Broad Agency Announcement for Basic and Applied Scientific Research”. This 
announcement succeeds BAA W911NF-17-S-0002 and BAA W911NF-17-S-0003 combining the 
opportunities into a single announcement.
ARL’s mission as the Army’s foundational research laboratory is to Operationalize Science to 
ensure overmatch in any future conflict. ARL’s foundational research mission spans basic 
research (budget activity   1) and applied research (budget activity   2) as defined by 32 CFR
2  105 but may include advanced technology development (budget activity   3) and advanced 
component development and prototypes (budget activity   4) when opportunities arise to directly 
or indirectly help achieve ARL’s mission. ARL partners across the national security enterprise to 
deliver fundamentally advantageous change that is rooted in the creation and exploitation of 
scientific knowledge.
Whitepapers for initial concept reviews and full proposals are sought from institutions of higher 
education, nonprofit organizations, state and local governments, foreign organizations, foreign 
public entities, and for-profit organizations (    large and small businesses) for scientific research 
that supports the ARL mission and the published ARL research topics of interest. Whitepapers 
and full proposals are expected to be for cutting-edge innovative research that could produce 
discoveries having a significant impact on enabling new and improved Army operational 
capabilities and related technologies.
In an effort to provide ARL's research topics and related information in an easy to digest format 
with search and filter options, ARL has published the following public website listing all current 
ARL research topics: https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/, hereafter referenced as the 
ARL BAA topics websit  Changes to these topics will be made using this website on an as 
needed basis. A change to the ARL BAA topics website is not an amendment to this BAA and 
will not be posted on https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/. A change to this document, 
the BAA itself, is an amendment and will be posted on https://www.grants.gov/ and 
https://sam.gov/. ARL will maintain a daily static snapshot of the ARL BAA topics website to 
ensure submissions are aligned with listed research topics on the day of submission.
Interested parties are encouraged to continually browse the ARL BAA topics website for white 
paper and proposal topics that ARL desires to explor  These specific research topics should be 
viewed as suggestive, rather than limiting. ARL is always interested in considering other 
innovative research concepts of relevance to the Army if those concepts align with ARL's mission. 
Please see Section II, Detailed Information about the Funding Opportunity, for more information
2
on the ARL research topics advertised through this BA  Interested parties should also review 
https://www.grants.gov/ and https://sam.gov/ to obtain the latest version of the BAA for 
whitepaper and proposal submission requirements.
To conserve valuable applicant and Government resources, and to facilitate determining whether a 
proposed research idea meets the guidelines described herein, prospective applicants 
contemplating submission of a whitepaper or proposal are strongly encouraged to contact an ARL 
Technical Point of Contact (TPOC) to first discuss the concept. The TPOCs’ names and contact 
information are listed within each topic description on the ARL BAA topics website.
After initial contact with an ARL TPOC, if an applicant elects to submit a whitepaper or proposal, 
it should be prepared in accordance with the instructions contained in this BA  Upon receipt, a 
whitepaper will be reviewed by the ARL TPOC and a recommendation will be provided to the 
applicant with either “encouraged to submit a proposal” or “not encouraged to submit a proposal” 
based on the review and availability of funding. A whitepaper is not required to submit a proposal. 
Proposals may be submitted at any time while this BAA is open.
The proposal submission guidelines differ for each legal instrument; therefore, applicants are 
advised to follow the specific applicable guidelines listed in this BAA for the type of instrument 
they are proposing. This BAA provides submission guidelines for proposals for FAR-based 
procurement contracts, as well as assistance instruments and other transactions. Upon review of a 
proposal, the government will advise applicants on the most appropriate instrument for the 
proposed work.
In accordance with federal statutes, regulations, and Department of Defense and Army policies, no 
person on grounds of race, color, age, sex, national origin, or disability shall be excluded from 
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or 
activity receiving financial assistance from the Army.
Applicants submitting proposals are cautioned that only a Contracting Officer, Grants Officer, or 
Agreements Officer can obligate the Government to any legal instrument involving federally 
appropriated funds.
All administrative inquiries regarding this BAA shall be submitted via the ARL Contact Us 
webpage: https://www.arl.army.mil/contact-us. Scientific and technical questions should be 
referred to the TPOCs listed with each topic on the ARL BAA topics website:

   DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY
  Program Description
   Foundational Research Topics of Interest
ARL’s mission is to serve as the Army’s principal foundational research agency. ARL is 
interested in all research proposals that can be shown to enable the future Army to deploy, 
fight, and win decisively against any adversary, anytime, and anywhere, in a joint, multidomain, high-intensity conflict, while simultaneously deterring others and maintaining its 
ability to conduct irregular warfare.
ARL comprises both the Army Research Directorate (ARD) and the Army Research Office 
(ARO) whose programs execute research awards under this BA  The ARD and ARO 
missions are further defined below to help clarify the different opportunities and topic types 
that may be found on ARL’s website.
ARL, through its ARD programs focuses on exploiting the most promising disruptive science 
and technology through in-house research with eligible entities. ARD competitively selects 
and funds innovative research concepts that can advance in-house research. ARD primarily 
funds basic research proposals (budget activity   1) and applied research proposals (budget 
activity   2) but may also select and fund advanced technology development (budget activity 
  3) and advanced component development and prototypes (budget activity   4) to exploit 
ARL’s foundational research outcomes and directly or indirectly help achieve ARL’s mission. 
The results of these research efforts are transitioned to the Army research and development 
community, industry, or academia to further the technological superiority of our Soldiers, 
Army, and nation. ARD-funded research represents a long-range Army view with system 
applications often 10-20 years away. ARD does not invest in incremental modernization 
improvements, but does invest in high-risk, high-payoff ideas in basic and applied science that 
can advance the in-house research mission. Historically, most of the ARD awards are executed 
as cooperative agreements but can include grants, procurement contracts, research other 
transactions (OTs) and prototype OTs. For a description of ARD targeted opportunities, see 
section 2 below.
ARL, through its ARO extramural research program, funds cutting-edge foundational research 
that could result in innovations having a significant impact on enabling new and improved 
Army operational capabilities and related technologies. ARO selects and funds eligible entities 
conducting scientific studies and experimentation toward advancing the state of the art or 
increasing basic knowledge and understanding across the sciences. ARO competitively selects 
and funds basic research proposals across a broad range of scientific disciplines related to longterm national security needs. ARO primarily funds basic research proposals (budget activity 
  1) but may also select and fund applied research proposals (budget activity   2). The results 
of these research efforts are transitioned to the Army research and development community, 
industry, or academia to further the technological superiority of our Soldiers, Army, and nation. 
ARO-funded research represents the most long-range Army view, with system applications
6
often 20–30 years away. The goal of ARO funding research proposals through this BAA is to 
pursue high-risk, high-payoff ideas in basic scienc  In this manner, ARO provides the Army 
with a dynamic method for rapidly investing or divesting in research to ensure the realization 
of foundational discoveries that will enable future Army capabilities. ARO has allocated 
funding each year to carry out the Army’s Extramural Research Program to fund foundational 
research proposals. Most of the ARO awards are executed primarily through grants and 
cooperative agreements, but also can include procurement contracts and other funding 
instruments. ARO also provides targeted opportunities, which are described in section 3 below.
In an effort to provide ARL’s research topics and related information in an easy to digest 
format with search and filter options, ARL has published the following public website listing 
all current ARL research topics: https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/, the ARL 
BAA topics websit  Interested parties are encouraged to continually browse this website to 
see the topics ARL is interested in.
To support ARL’s mission, an additional research topic for “Support to ARL Foundation 
Research Competencies” can be found on the ARL BAA topics websit  Under this research 
topic, ARL will consider whitepapers and proposals that may not directly align to a topic 
published by an ARL TPOC, but can demonstrate a strong alignment to ARL’s mission.
ARL’s research mission is executed within identified foundational research competencies that 
provide the Army foundational expertise and specialized capabilities grounded in scientific 
excellence and driven by unique Army challenges. ARL is always interested in innovative 
research whitepapers and proposals outside of the published topics on the ARL BAA topic 
website that demonstrate a strong alignment to ARL’s foundational research competencies and 
potential to create discovery, innovation, and transition of technologies for Army 
transformational overmatch. To learn more about ARL’s foundational research competencies 
visit the ARL website at https://www.arl.army.mil/what-we-do#competencies/.
A proposal submitted under the “Support to ARL Foundation Research Competencies” topic 
must clearly describe the research and objectives, and will be considered by ARL if it is 
aligned to one or more of these foundational research competencies that support the ARL 
mission. Applicants interested in submitting a proposal under this topic are strongly 
encouraged to first make preliminary inquiries as to the potential alignment to an ARL 
foundational research competency and funding availability for the type of research effort 
contemplated to the listed TPOC on the ARL BAA topics website.
   Army Research Directorate (ARD) Targeted Opportunities
ARD has no established targeted opportunities outside of the research topics considered for 
funding proposals submitted under this BA  Discussion with the cognizant ARD TPOC 
identified for a given ARD research topic published on the ARL public website is strongly 
recommended before submission of a whitepaper or proposal.
7
   Army Research Office (ARO) Targeted Opportunities
ARO has established several types of targeted opportunities to support ARO research topics, 
based on applications submitted under this BA  Information about the following 
opportunities is included below:
  Single Investigator (SI) Award
  Short-Term Innovative Research (STIR) Award
  Early Career Program (ECP) Award
  Research Instrumentation (RI) Award
  Conference and Symposia Grant Award
Unless special eligibility requirements are listed, the eligibility criteria of Section   C applies.
Also, see Section   E.1 of this BAA for the evaluation criteria related to these opportunities. 
NOTE: ARO is not limited to funding these targeted opportunities; however, they represent 
most awards ARO is expected to make.
  Single Investigator (SI) Award
   Description. SI awards are the most common awards. The objective of the award is to attract 
outstanding individuals to propose research projects related to the ARO research topics that
will result in scientific discoveries.
i   Research Sought. Proposals are sought for research that supports the ARO research topics 
identified on the ARL BAA topics website at https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/. 
As is the case for all other award types, discussions with the cognizant ARO TPOC identified 
for a given topic at the ARL BAA topics website is strongly recommended before submission 
of a whitepaper or proposal. The proposal is submitted by the institution where the individual 
is employe  
  Funding Level: ARO encourages discussions with ARO TPOCs for appropriate budget 
levels depending on the scope of effort. ARO’s standard funding levels for SI awards would 
support a budget for three years at a level commensurate with supporting a single investigator 
and one or two graduate students or a post-doc for three years (to include facilities and 
administrative [F&A] costs).
   Short-Term Innovative Research (STIR) Award
   Description. The objectives of the STIR awards are to support rapid, short-term 
investigations to assess the merit of innovative new concepts in basic research. STIR awards 
provide an excellent opportunity to showcase new concepts and explore new areas in basic 
research. Historically, STIR awards have helped shape new directions in research for the 
Army.
8
   Research Sought. Proposals are sought for research that supports the ARO research topics 
identified on the ARL BAA topics website at https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arlbaa/. As is the case for all other award types, discussions with the cognizant ARO TPOC 
identified for a given topic is strongly recommended before submission of a whitepaper or 
proposal for a STIR awar  
i   Funding Level. Proposals in the amount of $60,000 or less are sought for STIR 
awards. Capital equipment cannot be purchased under a STIR Program awar   Report
preparation costs must not exceed $100. A fee is not permitted under STIR Program awards as 
they are awarded as grants. Due to the relatively small dollar amount and short-term nature of 
these awards, applicants are encouraged to maximize the benefit derived from this funding by
prioritizing labor and employing other cost-saving measures in support of the STIR program 
effort.
  Special Proposal Preparation Instructions for STIR Awards.
Applicants should submit proposals with a Project Description (Technical Proposal) that is no 
more than ten (10) pages long. No brochures or explanatory material should be submitted with 
the proposal. Proposed research efforts must be "stand alone" and not predicated on the use of 
any facilities other than those under the direct control of the applicant. Research must be 
completed within nine (9) months of awar  
   Early Career Program (ECP) Award
   Description. ECP awards are funded by the Army to support early career scientists and 
engineers who show exceptional ability and promise for conducting basic research. This 
targeted opportunity is open to U.S. citizens, U.S. Nationals, or Lawful Permanent Residents of 
the U.S. who have held a tenure-track position at a U.S. institution of higher education for 
fewer than five years at the time of application. Faculty at an institution of higher education 
which does not designate a faculty appointment as "tenure track" are eligible if that fact is so 
indicated in the proposal, and the supporting letter from the institute states that the faculty 
member submitting the proposal will be considered for a permanent appointment. The 
objective of the ECP Award is to foster creative basic research in science and engineering; 
enhance development of outstanding early career investigators; and increase opportunities for 
early career investigators to pursue research in areas relevant to the Army.
   Research Sought. Proposals are sought for research that supports the ARO research topics 
identified on the ARL BAA topics website at https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/.
As is the case for all other award types, discussions with the cognizant ARO TPOC identified 
for a given topic is strongly recommended before submission of a whitepaper or proposal.
i   Funding Level. ECP awards will not exceed $120,000 per year for 3 years.
  Special Proposal Preparation Instructions for ECP Awards.
NOTE: The proposal is submitted by the institution where the individual is employe   The 
proposal must include a supporting letter, both through official channels in the institution 
9
where the individual is employe   The proposal must follow the format set forth in Section
    2 (Application and Submission Information) of this BA  The supporting letter must be 
from the individual's Department Chairperson, Dean, Supervisor, or other official who speaks
for the institution, and should address support for, and commitment to, the applicant. Strong 
institution support for the applicant is essential. Evidence of this support can include the 
applicant's salary, release time from administrative responsibilities, the purchase of equipment, 
support for the applicant's graduate students, any cost sharing, any start-up funding, et   The 
proposal must support the institution’s views that the individual is an outstanding investigator, 
and the institution is making a long-term commitment to the proposal and the research. Any 
resulting award will be made to the institution, not to the investigator.
   Research Instrumentation (RI) Award
   Description. RI awards are designed to improve the capabilities of U.S. institutions of higher 
education or a nonprofit whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research to conduct 
research and educate scientists and engineers in areas important to national defens  Funds 
provided in this award may be used to purchase instrumentation in support of this research or in 
the development of new research capabilities.
   Special Eligibility Requirements. RI awards are open to U.S. institutions of higher 
education and nonprofit organizations whose primary research is conducting scientific research 
in accordance with 31 USC §630  
i   RI and Research Topics. The RI program may provide funding to purchase 
instrumentation in support of ARO research topics listed on the ARL BAA topics website at 
https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/ or in the development of new research 
capabilities. It is highly recommended that potential applicants contact the appropriate ARO 
TPOC identified for a topic that aligns to this instrumentation proposal. The ARO TPOCs’ 
names and contact information are listed within each topic description on the ARL BAA topics 
website.
  Funding Level. ARO highly encourages discussions with ARO TPOCs of appropriate 
budget levels prior to the submission of RI proposals.
v. Special Proposal Preparation Instructions for RI Awards.
The request for instrumentation shall include the following elements:
   The “Project Abstract” is to describe the instrumentation requested and the research to be 
supported by that instrumentation.
   The “Project Description (Technical Proposal)” is to describe how the proposed 
instrumentation will: (i) establish new research capabilities, (ii) contribute to research currently 
proposed to DoD, or (iii) enhance the quality of research currently being funded by ARL. It 
will also include a description of how the proposed instrumentation will interface with or 
upgrade other research facilities and instrumentation now availabl  Finally, a description will 
be included of the amounts and sources of ongoing or proposed support for the research to be

supported by the instrumentation.
   In the “Cost Proposal,” the budget is to address the instrumentation to be purchased, cost 
per item, and total cost. Indicate the proposed source of the instrumentation and the name and 
telephone number of a contact at that sourc  The budget should indicate the amount of funds 
to be contributed by any other sources toward the purchase of the instrumentation. Note: Costs 
associated with equipment/facility modifications are generally considered unallowable and 
require the review and approval of the Grants Officer.
  Conference and Symposia Grant Awards
   Description. The Army supports conferences and symposia (as defined in the DoD 
Travel Regulations) in areas of science that bring expertstogether to discuss recent research 
or educational findings or to expose other researchers or advanced graduate students to new 
research and educational techniques. The Army encourages the convening in the United 
States of major international conferences, symposia, and assemblies of international 
alliances.
   Special Eligibility Requirements. Notwithstanding the Army's authority to provide grant 
support for such events DoD does not permit "co-sponsorship" (as defined in DoD 5500.07-R) 
absent additional high-level staffing and approval. In other words, the conference grant support 
identified in this BAA is not DoD sponsorship or co-sponsorship since ARL is neither an 
organizer nor provider of any substantial logistical support for the conferences addressed in this 
section. Funds provided cannot be used for payment to any federal government employee for 
support, subsistence, or services in connection with the proposed conference or symposium.
i   Connection with ARO Research Topics. The Army supports conferences and symposia in 
areas of science that bring experts together to discuss recent research or educational findings or 
to expose other researchers or advanced graduate students to new research and educational 
techniques. It is highly recommended that potential applicants contact the appropriate TPOC 
identified for a topic that aligns to the conference/symposia proposal. The ARO TPOCs’ 
names and contact information are listed within each topic description on the ARL BAA topics 
website at https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/.
  Funding Level. ARO highly encourages discussions with ARO TPOCs of appropriate 
budget levels prior to the submission of conference or symposia award applications.
v. Special Proposal Preparation Instructions for Conference or Symposia Awards.
   Conference support proposals should be submitted a minimum of six    months prior to the 
date of the conferenc  A proposal will not be funded if the conference date has already passe  
   The “Project Description (Technical Proposal)”, as discussed in for support of a conference 
or symposium should include the following:
  A one page or lesssummary indicating the objectives of the project;
  The topics to be covered;
  The location and probable date(s) and why the conference is considered appropriate at the
11
time specified;
  An explanation of how the conference will relate to the research interests of the Army and

   Cooperative Agreement. A legal instrument, consistent with 31 U.S.   6305, is used to 
enter into the same kind of relationship as a grant (see definition “grant”), except that 
substantial involvement is expected between the Federal Government and the recipient 
when carrying out the activity contemplated by the cooperative agreement. The term 
does not include “cooperative research and development agreements” as defined in 15

   Technology Investment Agreement. An assistance instrument as described in 32 CFR 
Part 37. A TIA may be a cooperative agreement or an Other Transaction for Research 
under 10 U.S.   4021 both with provisions tailored for involving commercial firms or 
research involving commercial application. To the maximum extent practicable, TIAs 
shall provide for a 50/50 cost share between the Government and the applicant. No fee 
or profit is allowed on TIAs.
   Other Transaction for Research. A legal instrument, consistent with 10 U.S.   4021,
13
which may be used for basic, applied, and advanced research projects. The research 
covered under thisinstrument cannot be duplicative of research being conducted under an 
existing DoD program. To the maximum extent practicable, OTsforresearch are to 
provide for a 50/50 cost share between the Government and the applicant. An 
applicant’s cost share may take the form of cash, independent research and development 
(IR&D), foregone intellectual property rights, equipment, access to unique facilities, 
and/or other means. Due to the extent of cost share, and the fact that an OT for research 
does not qualify as a “funding agreement” as defined at 37 CFR 40  2  , the intellectual 
property provisions of this instrument can be negotiated to provide expanded protection 
to an applicant’s intellectual property. No fee or profit is allowed on OTs for research.

   Content and Form of Application Submission
  The Application Process Overview
Applicants are strongly encouraged to follow the below application process:
  Conduct a preliminary inquiry with an ARL TPOC
  Submit a Whitepaper to an ARL TPOC for review
  Submit a Full Proposal
All proposals for Assistance Instruments (Grants, Cooperative Agreements, and Technology 
Investment Agreements) must be submitted electronically through Grants.gov using the 
Workspace system. Proposals for Procurement Contracts, OTs for Research that are not 
Technology Investment Agreements, and OTsfor Prototypes or Production may be submitted via 
either Grants.gov or email to usarmy.rtp.devcom-arl.mbx.baa@army.mil. See   D Application 
and Submission Information section of this BAA for information on the proposal submission 
process.
   Preliminary Inquiries*
Interested applicants are strongly encouraged to make a preliminary inquiry by first contacting 
the ARL TPOC to discuss your ideas and the interests of ARL. ARL receives several hundred 
research proposals annually and is able to provide support for only a limited number of the
17
proposals receive   ARL realizes the preparation of a research proposal often represents a 
substantial investment of time and effort by the applicant. Therefore, in an attempt to minimize 
this burden, ARL TPOCs are available to discuss the general need for the type of research 
effort contemplated and availability of funding before an interested applicant expends
extensive effort in preparing a whitepaper or full proposal. The TPOC names, telephone 
numbers, and email addresses are listed with each research Topic at the ARL BAA topics 
website, https://www.arl.army.mil/opportunities/arl-baa/, and they should be contacted, as 
appropriate, prior to the submission of whitepapers or proposals.
*NOTE: The Government will not be obligated by any discussion that arises out of 
preliminary inquiries.
   Whitepaper Preparation and Submission
   PURPOSE OF WHITEPAPERS:
Prospective proposers are strongly encouraged to submit whitepapers prior to the submission of 
a complete, more detailed proposal. The purpose of whitepapers is to minimize the labor and 
cost associated with the production of detailed proposals that have very little chance of being 
selected for funding. Whitepapers are not full proposals and are meant to provide the ARL 
TPOC with enough information to determine if there is interest on the part of ARL to receive a 
full proposal.
   WHITEPAPER CONTENT:
Whitepapers do not have a prescribed format but are not expected to exceed five    total pages 
and are encouraged to be submitted as a single portable document format (PDF) document. The 
whitepaper should include at a minimum the title of the whitepaper, name of the individual and 
organization submitting the whitepaper, the research topic name, topic identification (ID) 
number, and the TPOC name against which the whitepaper is submitte   Whitepapers should 
focus on describing objective and approach of the proposed research, including how it is 
innovative, and how it could substantially increase the scientific state of the art. Whitepapers 
should contain a brief cost estimate to understand a rough order of magnitude of the proposal 
cost, and any biographical information to highlight applicant’s qualifications and experience.
Any proprietary data must be clearly marke   The applicant must also identify any 
technical data or computer software contained in the whitepaper that is to be managed by 
the Government with restrictions, limited rights in technical data and restricted rights in 
computer softwar  In the absence of such identification, the Government will conclude 
there are no limitations or restrictions on technical data or computer software included in 
the whitepaper. Records or data bearing a restrictive legend may be included in the 
whitepaper. It is the intent of the Army to treat all whitepapers as procurement sensitive 
and to disclose their contents to Government employees or designated support contractors 
only for the purpose of evaluation.
18
i   SUBMISSION OF WHITEPAPERS:
Whitepapers should be submitted via email to the TPOC identified in the topic proposed 
against. Whitepaperssubmitted via email are encouraged to be submitted as a single PDF file 
as an email attachment. If no TPOC is specifically listed, prospective applicants can submit 
information and questions using the ARL’s website Contact Us page at 
https://www.arl.army.mil/contact-us and selecting BAA Inquiry from the drop-down menu 
for advice and assistance before preparing and submitting a whitepaper. In the contact form 
subject line, include the phrase “BAA Whitepaper Submission,” and the research topic name 
and topic ID number listed at the website.
  REVIEW OF WHITEPAPERS:
ARL TPOCs will receive and consider all whitepapers submitted and will provide a 
response with either “encouraged to submit a proposal” or “not encouraged to submit a 
proposal”.
   Full Proposal Preparation and Submission
Proposals must be submitted in order for the applicant to be considered for funding. 
Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit whitepapers (see instructions in       c White 
Paper Preparation and Submission section above) and received a recommendation from an 
ARL TPOC to submit a proposal prior to submitting full proposals, however all proposals 
submitted under the terms and conditions cited in this BAA will be reviewed regardless of the 
recommendation received from the ARL TPOC, or lack of submission of a whitepaper.
   COVER PAGE:
   A Cover Page is require   For contract proposals submitted by email, use ARO Form 5   
For all Assistance instruments and contract proposals submitted via Grants.gov, use the SF 
424 (R&R) Form. Proposals will not be processed without either:    a signed Cover Page, 
ARO Form 51, or    a SF 424 (R&R) Form.

   Review and Selection Process
  Upon receipt of a proposal, ARL staff will perform an initial review of its scientific merit and 
potential contribution to the Army mission, and also determine if funds are expected to be 
available for the effort. Proposals not considered having sufficient scientific merit or relevance to 
the Army's needs, or those in areas for which funds are not expected to be available, may not 
receive further review.
   All proposals are treated as procurement sensitive and are disclosed only for the purpose of 
evaluation. Proposals having sufficient scientific merit or relevance will be subject to a peer 
review by highly qualified subject matter experts, both Government employees and nonGovernment employees. While the applicant may restrict the evaluation to Government 
employees, to do so may prevent review of the proposal by other qualified expertsin the field of 
research covered by the proposal. The applicant must indicate on the appropriate proposal form 
(Form 52 or 52A) any limitation to be placed on disclosure of information contained in the 
proposal.
   Each proposal will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria in Section   E.1 of thisBAA 
rather than against other proposals for research in the same general are  Each evaluated 
proposal will receive a recommendation of “select” or “do not select” as supported by the 
evaluation.
   Upon completion of an evaluation against the criteria in Section   E.1, a proposal selected 
for possible award will be analyzed for the realism and reasonableness of costs and funds 
availability. Proposal costs must be determined reasonable and realistic before the Government 
can make an awar  
  Army Research Risk Assessment. Each proposal with a recommendation to “select” in 
accordance with      c above, whose costs have been determined to be reasonable and 
realistic in accordance with      d above, for which funds are available, and where a grant or 
cooperative agreement will be the award instrument type, will be subject to an Army Research 
Risk Assessment prior to awar  
   The Army Research Risk Assessment Program. The Army Research Risk Assessment 
Program (ARRP) is an adaptive risk management security program applied to Armyfunded research designed to help protect Army Science and Technology (S&T) by 
identifying possible vectors of undue foreign influence.
In order to identify and mitigate undue foreign influence as required by federal law and 
policy, the Army will perform a research risk assessment of each proposal selected 
based on the criteria above for consideration of a fundamental research grant or 
cooperative agreement awar   ARRP risk assessments for these subject proposals will 
be developed for all proposed Senior/Key personnel, (also referred to as “Covered 
Individuals”). These risk assessments will be based on information disclosed in the 
Standard Form (SF) 424, “Senior/Key Person Profile (Expanded),” any of its 
accompanying or referenced documents, publicly available information, and 
information contained in internal Army databases. Nationality or citizenship is not a 
factor in the risk assessment.
35
ARRP has a risk matrix which identifies risk factors and resulting risk ratings. The 
matrix generally looks at four factors, or risk areas: participation in foreign talent 
programs; denied entity list affiliation or association (see 
https://www.bis.do  gov/index.php/the-denied-persons-list and 
https://www.bis.do  gov/index.php/policy-guidance/lists-of-parties-of-concern/entitylist); funding sources to include conflict of interest or conflict of commitment, or 
funding from a strategic competitor; and foreign influence showing a pattern or history 
of affiliation, association, or collaboration with a foreign institution, person or entity 
from a U.S. strategic competitor. The matrix is set forth below:

  Conflict of Interest and Conflict of Commitment are defined in NSPM-33 and 
in the CONOP as well as the ARRP Policy memorandum.
  Senior/Key Personnel are those who    contribute in a substantive, meaningful 
way to the scientific development or execution of a research and development 
project proposed to be carried out with a research and development award from 
a Federal research agency; and    are designated as a covered individual by the 
Federal research agency concerne  
ARRP risk ratings range from LOW to HIGH depending on the amount, type, and 
timing of foreign associations or affiliations that could constitute a foreign-influenced 
“Conflict of Interest” or “Conflict of Commitment,” as defined by National Security 
Presidential Memorandum 33 (NSPM-33).
Once the research risk assessments are performed, the Army risk acceptance authority 
has several courses of action available for consideration. These courses of action are as 
follows:
Course of Action 1   The Army risk acceptance authority may accept the risk rating that 
results from the risk assessment process and proceed with the awar   This typically 
happens with proposals with risk ratings of “LOW” but could also happen with the 
other risk ratings. In Course of Action 1, the applicant will not be required to do 
anything related to the risk assessment process or the assigned risk rating. 
Course of Action 2   The Army risk acceptance authority may accept the risk rating 
with some research protection requirements added to the grant or cooperative agreement 
awar   This typically happens with proposals with risk ratings of “MODERATE” but 
37
could also happen with the other risk ratings. Also, typically, these added research 
protection requirements could include, but be limited to the following in the grant or 
cooperative agreement award:
o The University's Security Office shall provide the Principal Investigator and key 
personnel related to this award training on foreign talent recruitment programs 
and threat awareness and reporting requirements.
o The University shall disclose to the Army Research Laboratory Security Office 
and Grants Officer all international travel,   e., all international travel completed 
as part of any university business, by the Principal Investigator and key personnel 
related to this award instrument prior to travel.
o The University shall report to the Army Research Laboratory Security Office and 
Grants Officer all inquiries by foreign operatives or suspected foreign operatives 
into research associated with the awar  
o The University is encouraged to utilize students without potential conflicts of 
interest or conflicts of commitment as identified in U.S. National Security 
Presidential Memorandum (NSPM-33).
Under Course of Action 2, the applicant will be asked to sign the grant or cooperative 
agreement prior to award, confirming agreement to these added requirements. Should 
the applicant not agree to these added research protection requirements, the Army risk 
assessment authority may decide not to awar  
Course of Action 3   The Army risk acceptance authority is not willing to accept the 
risk assigned as a result of the assessment process. In this case, the applicant will be 
provided an opportunity to provide a risk mitigation plan. This typically happens with 
proposals with risk ratings of “HIGH” but could also happen with the other risk ratings. 
In Course of Action 3, the applicant will be informed of the risk rating assigned during 
the risk assessment process as well as the block(s) on the matrix where the review 
resulted in some type of finding that contributed to the assigned risk rating. Should the 
applicant choose to not submit a risk mitigation plan, the Army risk assessment 
authority may decide not to awar   Should the applicant choose to submit a risk 
mitigation plan, the Army will review such plan. As a result of this review, the Army 
risk acceptance authority may then be willing to accept the risk assigned with the 
mitigation plan and proceed with the award or the Army risk acceptance authority may 
not be willing to accept the risk and may decide not to awar   Further, should the risk 
mitigation plan include proposal revisions that affect those aspects of the proposal 
included in the review or selection process under SECTION      c, the original 
proposal evaluation will be reviewed and revised as appropriate based on the proposal 
revisions.

v.Definitions
  Covered Individual. An individual who contributes in a substantive, meaningful way 
to the scientific development or execution of a research and development project 
proposed to be carried out with a research and development award from a Federal 
research agency; and is designated as a covered individual by the Federal research 
agency concerne   See 42 U.S.   § 6605, Definitions. (For purposes of this BAA, 
“covered individuals” are all Senior/Key Personnel.)
  Senior/Key Research Personnel. This term includes the Principal Investigator (PI) and 
other individuals who contribute to the scientific development or execution of a project 
in a substantive, measurable way, whether or not they receive salaries or compensation 
under the awar   These include individuals whose absence from the project would be 
expected to impact the approved scope of the project. (For purposes of this BAA, 
“Senior/Key Personnel” are all considered “covered individuals.”
  Foreign Associations and Affiliations. Association is defined as collaboration, 
coordination or interrelation, professionally or personally, with a foreign governmentconnected entity where no direct monetary or non-monetary reward is involve   
Affiliation is defined as collaboration, coordination, or interrelation, professionally or 
personally, with a foreign government-connected entity where direct monetary or nonmonetary reward is involve  
  Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs. In general, these programs include 
any foreign-state-sponsored attempt to acquire U.S. scientific-funded research or 
technology through foreign government-run or funded recruitment programs that target 
scientists, engineers, academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs of all nationalities 
working and educated in the U.S. Distinguishing features of a Foreign Government 
Talent Recruitment Program may include:
  Compensation, either monetary or in-kind, provided by the foreign state to the 
targeted individual in exchange for the individual transferring their knowledge 
and expertise to the foreign country. In-kind compensation may include 
honorific titles, career advancement opportunities, promised future 
compensation or other types of remuneration or compensation.
  Recruitment, in this context, refers to the foreign-state-sponsor’s active 
engagement in attracting the targeted individual to join the foreign-sponsored 
program and transfer their knowledge and expertise to the foreign stat  The 
targeted individual may be employed and located in the U.S. or in the foreign 
state.
  Contracts for participation in some programs that create conflicts of 
commitment and/or conflicts of interest for researchers. These contracts include, 
but are not limited to, requirements to attribute awards, patents, and projects to 
the foreign institution, even if conducted under U.S. funding, to recruit or train 
other talent recruitment plan members, circumventing merit-based processes, 
and to replicate or transfer U.S.-funded work in another country.
41
  Many, but not all, of these programs aim to incentivize the targeted individual to 
physically relocate to the foreign stat  Of particular concern are those programs 
that allow for continued employment at U.S. research facilities or receipt of U.S. 
Government research funding while concurrently receiving compensation from 
the foreign state.
  Foreign Government Talent Recruitment Programs do not include research 
agreements between the University and a foreign entity, unless that agreement 
includes provisions that create situations of concern addressed elsewhere in this 
section; agreements for the provision of goods or services by commercial 
vendors; or invitations to attend or present at conferences.
  Conflict of Interest. A situation in which an individual, or the individual’s spouse or 
dependent children, has a financial interest or financial relationship that could directly 
and significantly affect the design, conduct, reporting, or funding of research.
  Conflict of Commitment. A situation in which an individual accepts or incurs 
conflicting obligations between or among multiple employers or other entities. 
Common conflicts of commitment involve conflicting commitments of time and effort, 
including obligations to dedicate time in excess of institutional or funding agency 
policies or commitments. Other types of conflicting obligations, including obligations 
to improperly share information with, or withhold information from, an employer or 
funding agency, can also threaten research security and integrity and are an element of 
a broader concept of conflicts of commitment.
  Foreign Component. Performance of any significant scientific element or segment of a 
program or project outside of the U.S., either by the University or by a researcher 
employed by a foreign organization, whether or not U.S. government funds are 
expende   Activities that would meet this definition include, but are not limited to: 
involvement of human subjects or animals; extensive foreign travel by University 
research program or project staff for the purpose of data collection, surveying, 
sampling, and similar activities; collaborations with investigators at a foreign site 
anticipated to result in co-authorship; use of facilities or instrumentation at a foreign 
site; receipt of financial support or resources from a foreign entity; or any activity of 
the University that may have an impact on U.S. foreign policy through involvement in 
the affairs or environment of a foreign country.
  Strategic Competitor. A nation, or nation-state, that engages in diplomatic, economic 
or technological rivalry with the United States where the fundamental strategic 
interests of the U.S are under threat.

as human subjects research (HSR), that is covered under 32 CFR part 219, or that meets 
exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101  , or expends funding on such effort, until you receive 
a formal notification of approval from the cognizant DoD Human Research Protection Official 
(HRPO). Approval to perform HSR under this award is received after the HRPO has performed
a review of the recipient’s documentation of planned HSR activities and has officially furnished a 
concurrence with the recipient’s determination as presented in the documentation.
   In order for the HRPO to accomplish this concurrence review, the recipient must provide 
sufficient documentation to enable his or her assessment as follows:
(i) If the HSR meets an exemption criteria under 32 CFR 219.101  , the documentation 
must include a citation of the exemption category under 32 CFR 219.101   and a 
rationale statement.
(ii) If the recipient’s activity is determined as “non-exempt research involving human 
subjects”, the documentation must include:

appropriate for the scope of work or program plan; and
− Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, as well as all documentation 
reviewed by the IRB to make their determination.
   The HRPO retains final judgment on what activities constitute HSR, whether an exempt 
category applies, whether the risk determination is appropriate, and whether the planned HSR 
activities comply with the requirements in paragraph    of this section.
   The recipient must notify the Grants Officer/Agreements Officer immediately of any 
suspensions or terminations of the Assurance of Compliance.
50
(f) DoD staff, consultants, and advisory groups may independently review and inspect the 
recipient’s research and research procedures involving human subjects and, based on such 
findings, DoD may prohibit research that presents unacceptable hazards or otherwise fails to 
comply with DoD requirements.

concerns to be considered fairly as subcontractors. All other than U.S. small businesses 
proposing contracts expected to exceed $750,000 and that have subcontracting possibilities are 
required to submit a subcontracting plan IAW FAR 19.702  , and shall do so with their 
proposal.
Subcontracting plans are determined to be acceptable or unacceptable based on the criteria 
established at FAR 19.705-4, DFARS 219.705-4, and AFARS 5119.705    Goals are 
established on an individual contract basis and should result in realistic, challenging and 
attainable goals that, to the greatest extent possible, maximize small business participation in 
subcontracting for Small Business, SDB, Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 
Economically-Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Business (EDWOSB), Service-Disabled 
Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), and 
Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Business consistent with 
applicants’ make-or-buy policy, the pool of and availability of qualified and capable small 
business subcontractors, their performance on subcontracts, and existing relationships with 
suppliers.
Subcontracting goals should result in efficient contract performance in terms of cost, schedule, 
and performance and should not result in increased costs to the Government or undue 
administrative burden to the prime contractor. More information on the Subcontracting program 
and the DoD Subcontracting goals may be found at:

  Reasoning for Submitting a Strong Cost Proposal
The ultimate responsibility of the Contracting Officer is to ensure that all prices offered in a 
proposal are fair and reasonable before contract awar   To establish the reasonableness of the 
offered prices, the Contracting Officer may ask the applicant to provide supporting 
documentation that assists in this determination. The applicant’s ability to be responsive to the 
Contracting Officer’s requests can expedite contract awar   As specified in Section 808 of
Public Law 105-261, an applicant who does not comply with a requirement to submit information 
for a contract or subcontract in accordance with paragraph      of FAR 1  403-3 may be 
ineligible for awar  
   DCAA-Accepted Accounting System
   Before a cost-reimbursement type contract can be awarded, the Contracting Officer must 
confirm that the applicant has a DCAA-accepted accounting system in place for accumulating 
and billing costs under Government contracts [FAR 5  209-1(f)]. If the applicant has DCAA 
correspondence, which documents the acceptance of its accounting system, this should be 
provided to the Contracting Officer (    attached or referenced in the proposal). Otherwise, the 
Contracting Officer will submit an inquiry directly to the appropriate DCAA office and request a 
review of the applicant’s accounting system.
   If an applicant does not have a DCAA-accepted accounting system in place, the DCAA 
review process can take several months depending upon the availability of the DCAA auditors 
and the applicant’s internal processes. This will delay contract awar  
i   For more information about cost proposals and accounting standards, view the link titled 
“Information for Contractors” on the main menu of the DCAA website.
   Field Pricing Assistance
During the pre-award cost audit process, the Contracting Officer may solicit support from DCAA 
to determine commerciality and price reasonableness of the proposal [FAR 1  404-2]. Any 
proprietary information or reports obtained from DCAA field audits will be appropriately 
identified and protected within the Government.
   Sample Cost Proposal – “Piece by Piece”
To help guide applicant s through the pre-award cost audit process, a sample cost proposal is 
detailed below. This sample allows the applicant to see exactly what the Government is looking 
for so that all cost and pricing back-up data can be provided to the Government in the first cost 
proposal submission. Review each cost element within the proposal, and take note of the types of 
documentation that the Contracting Officer will require from the applicant.
   Direct Labor: The first cost element included in the cost proposal is Direct Labor. Each 
proposed employee must be listed by name and labor category.
58
Below is the Direct Labor as proposed by our sample applicant:

Subtotal 
Direct 
Labor (DL)
$97,280.00 $100,198.40
   For this cost element, the Contracting Officer requires the applicant to provide adequate 
documentation in order to determine that the labor rate for each employee/labor category is fair 
and reasonabl  The documentation must explain how these labor rates were derive   For 
example, if the rates are DCAA-approved labor rates, provide the Contracting Officer with copies 
of the DCAA documents stating the approval. This is the most acceptable means of 
documentation to determine the rates fair and reasonabl  Other types of supporting 
documentation may include General Service Administration (GSA) contract price lists, actual 
payroll journals, or Salary.com research. If an employee listed in a cost proposal is not a current 
employee (maybe a new employee, or one contingent upon the award of this contract), a copy of 
the offer letter stating the hourly rate, signed and accepted by the employee, may be provided as 
adequate documentation.
Sometimes the hourly rates listed in a proposal are derived through subjective processes,   e., 
blending of multiple employees in one labor category, or averaged over the course of the year to 
include scheduled payroll increases, et   These situations should be clearly documented for the 
Contracting Officer.
   Another cost element in Direct Labor is labor escalation, or the increase in labor rates from 
year to year. In the example above, the proposed labor escalation is 3% (ex., Andy Smith’s direct 
labor rate increased by 3% from $5  00/hour in Year 1 to $5  65/hour in Year 2). Often times, 
an applicant may not propose escalation on labor rates during a 24-month perio   Whatever the 
proposed escalation rate is, please be prepared to explain why it is fair and reasonabl  For 
example, a sufficient explanation for our sample escalation rate would be “The Government’s 
General Schedule Increase and Locality Pay for the same time period (name fiscal year) in the
59
same location (name location) was published as   5%; therefore a 3% increase is fair and 
reasonable”.
   Other Direct Costs (ODCs): This section of the cost proposal includes all other directlyrelated costs required in support of the effort (  e., materials, subcontractors, consultants, travel, 
et  ). Any cost element that includes various items must be detailed in a cost breakdown.
   Direct Material Costs: This subsection of the cost proposal will include any special tooling, 
test equipment, and material costs necessary to perform the project. Items included in this 
section must be carefully reviewed relative to need and appropriateness for the work proposed, 
and must, in the opinion of the Contracting Officer, be advantageous to the Government and 
directly related to the specific top  
The Contracting Officer will require adequate documentation from the applicant to determine the 
cost reasonableness for each material cost propose   The following methods are ways in which 
the Contracting Officer can determine this [FAR 1  403-1]:
   Adequate Price Competition. A price is based on adequate price competition when 
the applicant solicits and receives quotes from two or more responsible vendors for the 
same or similar items or services. Based on these quotes, the applicant selects the vendor 
who represents the best value to the Government. The applicant will be required to 
provide to the Contracting Officer copies of all vendor quotes receive  
*NOTE: Price competition is not required for items at or below the micro-purchase 
threshold ($10,000   FAR 1  403-1]. If an item’s unit cost is less than or equal to
$10,000, price competition is not necessary. However, if an item’s total cost over the 
period of performance (unit cost x quantity) is higher than $10,000, two or more quotes 
must be obtained by the applicant.
   Commercial Prices. Commercial prices are those published on current price lists, 
catalogs, or market prices. This includes vendors who have prices published on a GSAschedule contract. The applicant will be required to provide copies of such price lists to 
the Contracting Officer.
   Prices set by law or regulation. If a price is mandated by the Government (    
pronouncements in the form of periodic rulings, reviews, or similar actions of a 
governmental body, or embodied in the laws) that is sufficient to set a price.
Below is the list of Direct Material costs included in our sample proposal:
DIRECT MATERIAL COSTS YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Raw Materials $35,000.00 $12,000.00
Computer for experiments $4,21  00 $0.00
Cable (item #12-3657, 300 ft) $1,27  00 $0.00
Software $1,82  00 $1,82  00
Subtotal Direct Materials Costs $42,31  00 $13,82  00
60
“Raw Materials”: This is a generic label used to group many material items into one cost item 
within the proposal. The Contracting Officer will require a detailed breakout of all the items that 
make up this cost. For each separate item over $10,000 (total for Year 1 + Year 2), the applicant 
must be able to provide either competitive quotes received, or show that published pricing was 
use  
“Computer for experiments”: This item is most likely a grouping of several components that 
make up one system. The Contracting Officer will require a detailed breakout of all the items 
that make up this cost. For each separate item over $10,000 (total for Year 1 + Year 2), the 
applicant must be able to provide either competitive quotes received, or show that published 
pricing was use  
“Cable”: Since this item is under the micro-purchase threshold of $10,000, competitive quotes or 
published pricing are not require   Simply provide documentation to show the Contracting 
Officer where this price came from.
“Software”: This cost item could include either one software product, or multiple products. If 
this includes a price for multiple items, please provide the detailed cost breakdown. Note: The 
price for Year 1 ($1,825) is below the micro-purchase threshold; however, in total (Year 1 + Year 
2) the price is over $10,000, so competitive quotes or published pricing documentation must be 
provide  
Due to the specialized types of products and services necessary to perform these projects, it may 
not always be possible to obtain competitive quotes from more than one reliable sourc  Each 
cost element over the micro-purchase threshold ($10,000) must be substantiate   There is always 
an explanation for how the cost of an item was derived; document how you came up with that 
price.
When it is not possible for an applicant to obtain a vendor price through competitive quotes or 
published price lists, the Contracting Officer may accept other methods to determine cost 
reasonableness. Below are some examples of other documentation, which the Contracting 
Officer may accept to substantiate costs:
   Evidence that a vendor/supplier charged another applicant a similar price for similar 
services. Has the vendor charged someone else for the same product? Two    to three
   invoices from that vendor to different customers may be used as evidence.
   Previous contract prices. Has the applicant charged the Government a similar price 
under another Government contract for similar services? If the Government has already 
paid a certain price for services, then that price may already be considered fair and 
reasonabl  Provide the contract number, and billing rates for reference.
   DCAA approve   Has DCAA already accepted or verified specific cost items 
included in your proposal? Provide a copy of DCAA correspondence that addressed these 
costs.
61
   ODCs: Below is the remaining ODC portion of our proposal including equipment, 
subcontractors, consultants, and travel. Assume in this scenario that competitive quotes or 
catalog prices were not available for these items:
ODCs YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Equipment Rental for Analysis $5,500.00 $5,600.00
Subcontractor – Widget, In   $25,000.00 $0.00
Consultant: John Bowers $0.00 $12,000.00
Travel $1,250.00 $1,250.00
Subtotal: ODCs $31,750.00 $18,850.00
“Equipment Rental for Analysis”: The applicant explains that the Year 1 cost of $5,500 is based 
upon 250 hours of equipment rental at an hourly rate of $2  00/hr. One    invoice from the 
vendor charging another vendor the same price for the same service is provided to the 
Contracting Officer as evidenc  Since this cost is over the micro-purchase threshold, further 
documentation to determine cost reasonableness is require   The applicant can furnish another 
invoice charging a second vendor the same price for the same service.
“Subcontractor – Widget, In  ”: The applicant provides a copy of the subcontractor quote to the 
Contracting Officer in support of the $25,000 cost. This subcontractor quote must include 
sufficient detailed information (equivalent to the data included in the prime’s proposal to the 
Government), so that the Contracting Officer can make a determination of cost reasonableness.
   As stated in Section   5     of the DoD Cost Proposal guidance, “All subcontractor 
costs and consultant costs must be detailed at the same level as prime contractor costs in 
regards to labor, travel, equipment, et   Provide detailed substantiation of subcontractor 
costs in your cost proposal.”
   In accordance with FAR 1  404-3, “the Contracting Officer is responsible for the 
determination of price reasonableness for the prime contract, including subcontracting 
costs”. This means that the subcontractor’s quote/proposal may be subject to the same 
scrutiny by the Contracting Officer as the cost proposal submitted by the prim  The 
Contracting Officer will need to determine whether the subcontractor has an accepted 
purchasing system in place and/or conduct appropriate cost or price analyses to establish 
the reasonableness of proposed subcontract prices. Due to the proprietary nature of cost 
data, the subcontractor may choose to submit their pricing information directly to the 
Contracting Officer and not through the prim  This is understood and encourage  
   When a subcontractor is selected to provide support under the prime contract due to 
its specialized experience, the Contracting Officer may request sole source justification 
from the applicant.
“Consultant – John Bowers”: The applicant shall provide a copy of the consultant’s quote to the 
Contracting Officer as evidenc  In this example, the consultant will be charging an hourly rate 
of $125 an hour for 96 hours of support. The applicant indicates to the Contracting Officer that
62
this particular consultant was used on a previous contract with the Government (provide contract 
number), and will be charging the same rat  A copy of the consultant’s invoice to the applicant 
under the prior contract is available as supporting evidenc  Since the Government has paid this 
price for the same services in the past, determination has already been made that the price is fair.
“Travel”: The Contracting Officer will require a detailed cost breakdown for travel expenses to 
determine whether the total cost is reasonable based on Government per diem and mileage rates. 
This breakdown shall include the number of trips, the destinations, and the number of travelers. 
It will also need to include the estimated airfare per round trip, estimated car rental, lodging rate 
per trip, tax on lodging, and per diem rate per trip. The lodging and per diem rates must comply 
with the Joint Travel Regulations. Please see the following website to determine the appropriate 
lodging and per diem rates: http://www.defensetravel.do  mil. Additionally, the applicant must 
provide why the airfare is fair and reasonable as well. Sufficient back up for both airfare and car 
rental would include print outs of online research at the various travel search engines (Expedia, 
Travelocity, et  ), documenting the prices for airfare and car rentals are fair and reasonable.
Below is a sample of the travel portion:
TRAVEL Unit Trips Travelers Nights Days Unit Cost Total Travel
Airfare roundtrip 1 1 $99  00 $99  00
Lodging day 1 1 1 $7  00 $7  00
Tax on Lodging 
(12%) day 1 1 1 $9.00 $9.00
Per Diem day 1 1 2 $4  00 $88.00
Automobile 
Rental day 1 1 2 $4  00 $8  00
Subtotal Travel $1,250.00
i   Indirect Costs: Indirect costs include elements such as fringe benefits, general and 
administrative (G&A), overhead, and material handling costs. The applicant shall indicate in the 
cost proposal both the indirect rates (as a percentage) as well as how those rates are allocated to 
the costs in the proposal.
Below is the indirect portion of our sample proposal:
63
INDIRECTS YEAR 1 YEAR 2
Subtotal Direct Labor (DL): $97,280.00 $100,198.40
Fringe Benefits, if not included in Overhead, rate 
(1  0000 %) X DL =
$14,59  00 $15,029.76
Labor Overhead (rate 4  0000 %) X (DL + Fringe) = $50,34  40 $51,85  67
Total Direct Labor (TDL): $162,21  40 $167,080.83
In this example, the applicant includes a fringe benefit rate of 1  00% that it allocated to the 
direct labor costs. The applicant also proposes a labor overhead rate of 4  00% that is allocated 
to the direct labor costs plus the fringe benefits.
All indirect rates and the allocation methods of those rates must be verified by the Contracting 
Officer. In most cases, DCAA documentation supporting the indirect rates and allocation 
methods can be obtained through a DCAA field audit or proposal review. Many applicants have 
already completed such reviews and have this documentation readily availabl  If an applicant is 
unable to participate in a DCAA review to substantiate indirect rates, the Contracting Officer 
may request other accounting data from the applicant to make a determination.
  Facilities Capital Cost of Money (FCCM): Cost of money is an imputed cost that is not a 
form of interest on borrowings (see FAR 3  205-20). FCCM is an “incurred cost” for costreimbursement purposes under applicable cost-reimbursement contracts and for progress 
payment purposes under fixed-price contracts. It refers to    FCCM (48 CFR 990  414) and    
cost of money as an element of the cost of capital assets under construction (48 CFR 990  417). 
If cost of money is proposed in accordance with FAR 3  205-10, a DD Form 1861 is required to 
be completed and submitted with the applicant’s proposal.
v. Fee/Profit: The proposed fee percentage will be analyzed in accordance with DFARS 
21  404, the Weighted Guidelines Metho  
v   Subcontracting Plan: If the total amount of the proposal exceeds $750,000 and the applicant 
is a large business or an institute of higher education (other than HBCU/MI) and the resultant 
award is a contract, the applicant shall be prepared to submit a subcontracting plan for small 
business and SDB concerns. A mutually agreeable plan will be included in and made a part of 
the contract (see Section   F.    v).
   GRANT and COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT Proposals
Before award it must be established that an approved accounting system and financial 
management system exist.
64
  Direct Labor: Show the current and projected salary amounts in terms of man-hours, manmonths, or annual salary to be charged by the PI(s), faculty, research associates, postdoctoral 
associates, graduate and undergraduate students, secretarial, clerical, and other technical 
personnel either by personnel or position. State the number of man-hours used to calculate a 
man-month or man-year. For proposals from universities, research during the academic term is 
deemed part of regular academic duties, not an extra function for which additional compensation 
or compensation at a higher rate is warrante   Consequently, academic term salaries shall not be 
augmented either in rate or in total amount for research performed during the academic term. 
Rates of compensation for research conducted during non-academic (summer) terms shall not 
exceed the rate for the academic terms. When part or all of a person's services are to be charged 
as project costs, it is expected that the person will be relieved of an equal part or all of his or her 
regular teaching or other obligations. For each person or position, provide the following 
information:
   The basis for the direct labor hours or percentage of effort (e.g., historical hours or 
estimates);
   The basis for the direct labor rates or salaries. Labor costs should be predicted upon 
current labor rates or salaries. These rates may be adjusted upward for forecast salary or 
wage cost-of-living increases that will occur during the agreement perio   The cost 
proposal should separately identify the rationale applied to base salary/wage for cost-ofliving adjustments and merit increases. Each must be fully explained;
i   The portion of time to be devoted to the proposed research, divided between academic 
and non-academic (summer) terms, when applicable;
  The total annual salary charged to the research project; and
v. Any details that may affect the salary during the project, such as plans for leave and/or 
remuneration while on leave.
Note: There is no page limitation for budget proposals or budget justifications.
   Fringe Benefits and Indirect Costs (Overhead, G&A, and Other): The most recent rates, dates 
of negotiation, the base(s) and periods to which the rates apply must be disclosed and a statement 
included identifying whether the proposed rates are provisional or fixe   If the rates have been 
negotiated by a Government agency, state when and by which agency. A copy of the negotiation 
memorandum should be provide   If negotiated forecast rates do not exist, applicants must 
provide sufficient detail to enable a determination to be made that the costs included in the 
forecast rate are allocable according to applicable cost provisions. Applicants' disclosure should 
be sufficient to permit a full understanding of the content of the rate(s) and how it was 
establishe   As a minimum, the submission should identify:
   All individual cost elements included in the forecast rate(s);
   Basis used to prorate indirect expenses to cost pools, if any;
65
i   How the rate(s) was calculated;
  Distribution basis of the developed rate(s);
v. Basis on which the overhead rate is calculated, such as "salaries and wages" or "total 
costs;" and
v   The period of the applicant's fiscal year.
   Permanent Equipment: If facilities or equipment are required, a justification why this property 
should be furnished by the Government must be submitte   State the organization's inability or 
unwillingness to furnish the facilities or equipment. Applicants must provide an itemized list of 
permanent equipment showing the cost for each item. Permanent equipment is any article or 
tangible nonexpendable property having a useful life of more than one year and an acquisition 
cost of $5,000 or more per unit. The basis for the cost of each item of permanent equipment 
included in the budget must be disclosed, such as:
   Vendor Quote: Show name of vendor, number of quotes received and justification, if 
intended award is to other than lowest bidder.
   Historical Cost: Identify vendor, date of purchase, and whether or not cost represents 
lowest b   Include reason(s) for not soliciting current quotes.
i   Engineering Estimate: Include rationale for quote and reason for not soliciting current 
quotes.
If applicable, the following additional information shall be disclosed in the applicant’s cost 
proposal:
  Special test equipment to be fabricated by the awardee for specific research purposes 
and its cost.
v. Standard equipment to be acquired and modified to meet specific requirements, 
including acquisition and modification costs, listed separately.
